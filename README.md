# RedditBrowser - Browse Reddit in Minecraft [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Delta2Force/redditbrowser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Delta2Force/redditbrowser)
(For some reason, the branch I made for more interaction is still registered in travis and will always fail since it doesn't exist anymore.)

## Installation
Download the latest version from the releases tab and put it in your plugins tab.

## Usage
When the plugin is first launched, a config file for it will be created. In this file you will have to enter the data from a Reddit application. Google „Reddit application page“ and create a script application. The username and password have to be from your account. Don’t worry, nothing gets sent to me. You can look inside of the code if you are worried. If you still don’t trust me, just create a throwaway. The client id is the text under the application name and the secret is labeled „secret“. I’m not sure if this works without this, but I advise to do it. After this, you don’t have to reload the server. Just to /reddit and it should work.

Use `/reddit` in chat and then place a sign with the subreddit name (including r/ !)

When you are in the tower, you can upvote the post by clicking the button left or downvote by clicking the button right.
You can leave a comment by writing a book using your book and quill and putting it in the comment chest.

You can inspect a comment thread by right clicking on a comment. You will then see the commentsEnabled under that comment. If you right click on those, you'll see the commentsEnabled of those, and so on.

### The posts are in a very low resolution since they have to be downscaled to 128x128 to fit on a minecraft map. You can see the post at its highest resolution by right clicking the image.
