# RedditBrowser - Browse Reddit in Minecraft [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/eogra7/redditbrowser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/eogra7/redditbrowser)

## Usage
Use `/reddit` in chat and then place a sign with the subreddit name (including r/ !)

When the plugin is first launched, a config file for it will be created. In this file you will have to enter the data from a Reddit application. Google „Reddit application page“ and create a script application. The username and password have to be from your account. Don’t worry, nothing gets sent to me. You can look inside of the code if you are worried. If you still don’t trust me, just create a throwaway. The client id is the text under the application name and the secret is labeled „secret“. I’m not sure if this works without this, but I advise to do it. After this, you don’t have to reload the server. Just to /reddit and it should work.
